# Shared System Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files that apply to both GNOME and KDE
desktop environments.

## Purpose

Shared configurations include:
- Common keyboard shortcuts
- Cross-desktop application defaults
- System-wide security and privacy settings
- Shared development environment configs

## Examples

- Terminal shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+T) that work in both desktops
- Common mime type associations
- Shared application launchers
- System documentation
